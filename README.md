Image Colorization Using GANs 

Welcome to the Image Colorization project using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This project aims to colorize black and white images using advanced deep learning techniques. We leverage GANs to generate realistic colors for grayscale images.

Colorizing black and white images can significantly enhance their aesthetic and informational value. This project uses a GAN-based approach to learn the mapping from grayscale to color images. The model comprises a generator that colorizes the image and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and generated color images, ensuring high-quality output.
